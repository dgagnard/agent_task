            "Yahoo Finance Google stock rises after it beats on earnings, raises dividend, and authorizes $70 billion in buybacks  Daniel Howley Daniel Howley · Technology Editor Updated Fri, April 25, 2025 at 3:36 PM GMT+2 2 min read  In This Article: StockStory Top Pick MSFT +0.06%  GOOG +2.70%  AMZN +0.16%  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock rose over 3% Friday after the company reported strong fiscal first quarter earnings, beating expectations. It also announced a 5% dividend increase and $70 billion in stock buybacks.  For Q1, Alphabet reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.81 on revenue of $90.2 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.01 on revenue of $89.1 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.  NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)  Follow View Quote Details 165.84 +4.69 +(2.70%) As of 10:02:02 AM EDT. Market Open. Advanced Chart Date\t Close\t Open\t High\t Low\t 1D5D1M6MYTD1Y5YAll The company reported earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $80.5 billion during the same period last year.  Google's advertising revenue topped out at $66.8 billion versus expectations of $66.4 billion. Google Cloud Platform revenue was $12.2 billion versus expectations of $12.3 billion. The segment saw $9.5 billion in revenue in Q1 2024.  Google is among the first Big Tech companies to report its earnings since President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff plan sent markets into a tailspin and raised the specter of a possible economic recession, something analysts say could impact second-half earnings.  \"We have seen some transaction velocity in e-commerce drop off of late, and given the macro noise, would expect digital ads to weaken in 2Q,\" Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in an April 8 investor note.  The company is also contending with the fallout from its twin antitrust losses. Last week, a US federal judge found that Google holds an illegal monopoly over the online advertising market, which could force it to sell off or reorganize its ads business.  The loss comes less than a year after a judge found that Google's search and ad businesses also violated antitrust laws.  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2025/04/17: General view of the Google headquarters in King&#39;s Cross as the tech giant faces a 5 billion pound lawsuit in the UK for allegedly abusing its online search dominance.

            " Yahoo Finance Google stock rises after it beats on earnings, raises dividend, and authorizes $70 billion in buybacks  Daniel Howley Daniel Howley · Technology Editor Updated Fri, April 25, 2025 at 3:36 PM GMT+2 2 min read  In This Article: StockStory Top Pick MSFT +0.06%  GOOG +2.70%  AMZN +0.16%  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock rose over 3% Friday after the company reported strong fiscal first quarter earnings, beating expectations. It also announced a 5% dividend increase and $70 billion in stock buybacks.  For Q1, Alphabet reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.81 on revenue of $90.2 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.01 on revenue of $89.1 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.  NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)  Follow View Quote Details 165.84 +4.69 +(2.70%) As of 10:02:02 AM EDT. Market Open. Advanced Chart Date\t Close\t Open\t High\t Low\t 1D5D1M6MYTD1Y5YAll The company reported earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $80.5 billion during the same period last year.  Google's advertising revenue topped out at $66.8 billion versus expectations of $66.4 billion. Google Cloud Platform revenue was $12.2 billion versus expectations of $12.3 billion. The segment saw $9.5 billion in revenue in Q1 2024.  Google is among the first Big Tech companies to report its earnings since President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff plan sent markets into a tailspin and raised the specter of a possible economic recession, something analysts say could impact second-half earnings.  \"We have seen some transaction velocity in e-commerce drop off of late, and given the macro noise, would expect digital ads to weaken in 2Q,\" Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in an April 8 investor note.  The company is also contending with the fallout from its twin antitrust losses. Last week, a US federal judge found that Google holds an illegal monopoly over the online advertising market, which could force it to sell off or reorganize its ads business.  The loss comes less than a year after a judge found that Google's search and ad businesses also violated antitrust laws.  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2025/04/17: General view of the Google headquarters in King&#39;s Cross as the tech giant faces a 5 billion pound lawsuit in the UK for allegedly abusing its online search dominance.

            "Intel beats on Q1 expectations, but poor Q2 forecast sends stock sliding  Daniel Howley Daniel Howley · Technology Editor Updated Fri, April 25, 2025 at 3:39 PM GMT+2 2 min read  In This Article: INTC -7.82%  Intel's (INTC) stock fell over 7% Friday after a disappointing outlook overshadowed an earnings beat.  In the coming quarter, Intel says it expects second quarter revenue of between $11.2 billion and $12.4 billion. Wall Street was looking for $12.8 billion.  “The current macro environment is creating elevated uncertainty across the industry, which is reflected in our outlook. We are taking a disciplined and prudent approach to support continued investment in our core products and foundry businesses while maximizing operational cost savings and capital efficiency,” Intel CFO David Zinsner said in a statement.  Shares are off over 40% in the past 12 months.  NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD Intel Corporation (INTC)  Follow View Quote Details 19.81 -1.68 (-7.82%) As of 9:41:06 AM EDT. Market Open. Advanced Chart Date\t Close\t Open\t High\t Low\t 1D5D1M6MYTD1Y5YAll For the first quarter, Intel saw adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.13 on revenue of $12.7 billion. Analysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $0.01 on revenue of $12.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.  The company saw EPS of $0.18 and revenue of $12.7 billion in the same period last year.  Intel also reported client computing revenue of $7.6 billion versus expectations of $6.9 billion.  Data center and AI segment revenue came in at $4.1 billion versus expectations of $2.9 billion. Intel Foundry revenue topped out at $4.6 billion. Analysts were looking for $4.3 billion.   The earnings announcement, the first since new CEO Lip-Bu Tan took the reins of the ailing chip giant last month, comes as Intel girds itself for the potential fallout from President Trump's trade war with China.  While Intel produces the bulk of its chips in the US, it is still susceptible to tariffs on laptops and other systems built in China. And while computers are currently exempt from tariffs, the Trump administration has signaled that it plans to reintroduce duties on those devices when it launches tariffs on semiconductors in the coming weeks and months.

As a result, we have been too slow to adapt and to meet your needs. You deserve better, and we need to improve. And we will,\" Tan said during the event.  Wall Street is waiting for some kind of news about how the newly appointed CEO will move forward with Intel's third-party foundry business. Analysts have called for everything from getting the company out of the chip manufacturing business to backing away from its attempt to turn into a third-party chipmaker akin to TSMC.  Earlier this month, the Information reported that Intel and TSMC reached a preliminary agreement that would see the two companies form a joint venture to operate Intel's chip fabrication facilities.\u001b[00m\n",

            " Intel beats on Q1 expectations, but poor Q2 forecast sends stock sliding  Daniel Howley Daniel Howley · Technology Editor Updated Fri, April 25, 2025 at 3:39 PM GMT+2 2 min read  In This Article: INTC -7.82%  Intel's (INTC) stock fell over 7% Friday after a disappointing outlook overshadowed an earnings beat.  In the coming quarter, Intel says it expects second quarter revenue of between $11.2 billion and $12.4 billion. Wall Street was looking for $12.8 billion.  “The current macro environment is creating elevated uncertainty across the industry, which is reflected in our outlook. We are taking a disciplined and prudent approach to support continued investment in our core products and foundry businesses while maximizing operational cost savings and capital efficiency,” Intel CFO David Zinsner said in a statement.  Shares are off over 40% in the past 12 months.  NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD Intel Corporation (INTC)  Follow View Quote Details 19.81 -1.68 (-7.82%) As of 9:41:06 AM EDT. Market Open. Advanced Chart Date\t Close\t Open\t High\t Low\t 1D5D1M6MYTD1Y5YAll For the first quarter, Intel saw adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.13 on revenue of $12.7 billion. Analysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $0.01 on revenue of $12.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.  The company saw EPS of $0.18 and revenue of $12.7 billion in the same period last year.  Intel also reported client computing revenue of $7.6 billion versus expectations of $6.9 billion.  Data center and AI segment revenue came in at $4.1 billion versus expectations of $2.9 billion. Intel Foundry revenue topped out at $4.6 billion. Analysts were looking for $4.3 billion.   The earnings announcement, the first since new CEO Lip-Bu Tan took the reins of the ailing chip giant last month, comes as Intel girds itself for the potential fallout from President Trump's trade war with China.  While Intel produces the bulk of its chips in the US, it is still susceptible to tariffs on laptops and other systems built in China. And while computers are currently exempt from tariffs, the Trump administration has signaled that it plans to reintroduce duties on those devices when it launches tariffs on semiconductors in the coming weeks and months.

As a result, we have been too slow to adapt and to meet your needs. You deserve better, and we need to improve. And we will,\" Tan said during the event.  Wall Street is waiting for some kind of news about how the newly appointed CEO will move forward with Intel's third-party foundry business. Analysts have called for everything from getting the company out of the chip manufacturing business to backing away from its attempt to turn into a third-party chipmaker akin to TSMC.  Earlier this month, the Information reported that Intel and TSMC reached a preliminary agreement that would see the two companies form a joint venture to operate Intel's chip fabrication facilities.\u001b[00m\n",

            "Yahoo Finance Slate: Introducing the Bezos-backed EV pickup for the masses With only one form factor and color, the $25K cheap EV is aimed at regular Americans but embraces DIY culture with a myriad of aftermarket options.  Pras Subramanian Pras Subramanian · Senior Reporter Fri, April 25, 2025 at 4:21 AM GMT+2 4 min read  In This Article: RIVN +0.70%  AMZN +3.29%  “We built it, you make it.”  That’s the motto for Slate, a new American electric vehicle company, which just revealed its launch model and is backed by ex-Amazon (AMZN) executives, including, reportedly, Jeff Bezos’s family office  Slate said its EV pickup, a bare-bones truck with a footprint smaller than a Ford (F) Maverick, will cost somewhere in the mid-$20K range, and it will come in any color you want — as long as it’s slate gray, that is. The option-challenged vehicle offers a choice of two battery sizes for the rear-wheel-drive truck: a 52.7-kWh battery pack targeting 150 miles of range and an 84.3-kWh pack with 240 miles of range.  Slate&#39;s new mid-$20K EV  The Amazon truck?

This is where the “make it” part comes in, because the customers will install these items themselves.  Buyers can also choose to do none of these things and have a cheap, utilitarian pickup.  “The auto industry has abandoned the working class in America. And what I think is so exciting and different about Slate is that we have taken this stance that we're going to build cars for working-class America, in America, for Americans,” Jeremy Snyder, Slate’s chief commercial officer, told Yahoo Finance. “It's just something that's been lost.”  Slate&#39;s new mid-$20K EV  Working class: Another view of the Slate. (Photo courtesy of Slate) · Slate Slate’s founders, former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke and MIT classmate Miles Arnone, aimed to make this vehicle so American workers of all stripes could have cheap, reliable, and efficient transportation.  As previously reported by TechCrunch, there are several former Amazon executives involved with Slate and one big investor: Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos.  Bezos, through his family office, reportedly holds a passive stake and is not directly involved in the day-to-day business. Snyder said Slate wouldn’t comment on Bezos’s involvement.  Slate&#39;s new mid-$20K EV  Cheap EV chic: Inside the Slate (Photo: courtesy Slate) · Slate Nevertheless, unlike Amazon’s other EV investment, Rivian (RIVN), Snyder said Slate will be cash flow positive shortly after production, which will begin in late 2026.  Hitting that metric is a tough ask in the current automotive environment, where the industry has seen EV sales growth slow after massive gains earlier in the decade. The prospect of the federal EV tax credit going away is also a threat, in addition to the negative effects of President Trump’s tariffs on critical supply chains.  Synder said the company is able to hit its profitability goals because all its parts are made in America (save items like tires), and vehicle parts are not stamped. The exterior parts are composite pieces that are easier to make and avoid Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Customization options for Slate&#39;s EV pickup include vinyl wraps, wheel covers, and even an SUV top. Build your Slate: customization options include vinyl wraps, wheel covers, and even an SUV top (Photo: courtesy Slate) · Slate In addition, the exterior parts are already dyed slate gray, meaning there’s no paint shop either, thus lowering manufacturing costs. And with no options available at the factory, assembly is much simpler and can be done within a smaller footprint.  Slate hasn’t revealed its manufacturing location yet or how many vehicles it intends to build when volume production is met.  One key to reaching the profitability goals is the higher-margin customization business. Snyder, who cut his teeth building out Tesla’s retail network, sees customers being able to buy parts to customize their Slate EVs, akin to the App Store for iPhones.  “We're all about DIY,\" Snyder said. “It's a very open-source ethos that allows customers to either like the vehicle [as is],\" or, he added, \"They can choose whatever color they want. They can do custom print on their wrap to make it however they want, they can 3D-print headlight covers and taillight covers.”  Snyder added, “Everybody wants to be a maker, everybody wants to stand out. Everybody wants to do their own thing ... we're giving the perfect platform for that.”  Prospective customers can put their name on the reservation list starting immediately.

            " Yahoo Finance Slate: Introducing the Bezos-backed EV pickup for the masses With only one form factor and color, the $25K cheap EV is aimed at regular Americans but embraces DIY culture with a myriad of aftermarket options.  Pras Subramanian Pras Subramanian · Senior Reporter Fri, April 25, 2025 at 4:21 AM GMT+2 4 min read  In This Article: RIVN +0.70%  AMZN +3.29%  “We built it, you make it.”  That’s the motto for Slate, a new American electric vehicle company, which just revealed its launch model and is backed by ex-Amazon (AMZN) executives, including, reportedly, Jeff Bezos’s family office  Slate said its EV pickup, a bare-bones truck with a footprint smaller than a Ford (F) Maverick, will cost somewhere in the mid-$20K range, and it will come in any color you want — as long as it’s slate gray, that is. The option-challenged vehicle offers a choice of two battery sizes for the rear-wheel-drive truck: a 52.7-kWh battery pack targeting 150 miles of range and an 84.3-kWh pack with 240 miles of range.

This is where the “make it” part comes in, because the customers will install these items themselves.  Buyers can also choose to do none of these things and have a cheap, utilitarian pickup.  “The auto industry has abandoned the working class in America. And what I think is so exciting and different about Slate is that we have taken this stance that we're going to build cars for working-class America, in America, for Americans,” Jeremy Snyder, Slate’s chief commercial officer, told Yahoo Finance. “It's just something that's been lost.”  Slate&#39;s new mid-$20K EV  Working class: Another view of the Slate. (Photo courtesy of Slate) · Slate Slate’s founders, former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke and MIT classmate Miles Arnone, aimed to make this vehicle so American workers of all stripes could have cheap, reliable, and efficient transportation.  As previously reported by TechCrunch, there are several former Amazon executives involved with Slate and one big investor: Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos.  Bezos, through his family office, reportedly holds a passive stake and is not directly involved in the day-to-day business. Snyder said Slate wouldn’t comment on Bezos’s involvement.  Slate&#39;s new mid-$20K EV  Cheap EV chic: Inside the Slate (Photo: courtesy Slate) · Slate Nevertheless, unlike Amazon’s other EV investment, Rivian (RIVN), Snyder said Slate will be cash flow positive shortly after production, which will begin in late 2026.  Hitting that metric is a tough ask in the current automotive environment, where the industry has seen EV sales growth slow after massive gains earlier in the decade. The prospect of the federal EV tax credit going away is also a threat, in addition to the negative effects of President Trump’s tariffs on critical supply chains.  Synder said the company is able to hit its profitability goals because all its parts are made in America (save items like tires), and vehicle parts are not stamped. The exterior parts are composite pieces that are easier to make and avoid Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Customization options for Slate&#39;s EV pickup include vinyl wraps, wheel covers, and even an SUV top. Build your Slate: customization options include vinyl wraps, wheel covers, and even an SUV top (Photo: courtesy Slate) · Slate In addition, the exterior parts are already dyed slate gray, meaning there’s no paint shop either, thus lowering manufacturing costs. And with no options available at the factory, assembly is much simpler and can be done within a smaller footprint.  Slate hasn’t revealed its manufacturing location yet or how many vehicles it intends to build when volume production is met.  One key to reaching the profitability goals is the higher-margin customization business. Snyder, who cut his teeth building out Tesla’s retail network, sees customers being able to buy parts to customize their Slate EVs, akin to the App Store for iPhones.  “We're all about DIY,\" Snyder said. “It's a very open-source ethos that allows customers to either like the vehicle [as is],\" or, he added, \"They can choose whatever color they want. They can do custom print on their wrap to make it however they want, they can 3D-print headlight covers and taillight covers.”  Snyder added, “Everybody wants to be a maker, everybody wants to stand out. Everybody wants to do their own thing ... we're giving the perfect platform for that.”  Prospective customers can put their name on the reservation list starting immediately.

            "Reuters STMicro forecasts better quarterly sales, says no tariff panic yet  FILE PHOTO: The logo of STMIcroelectronics is seen outside a company building in Montrouge · Reuters Nathan Vifflin Thu, April 24, 2025 at 7:16 AM GMT+2 2 min read  In This Article: STMPA.PA +1.09%  By Nathan Vifflin  (Reuters) -STMicroelectronics said U.S. tariffs had so far not changed its conversations with customers, after the chipmaker forecast rising second-quarter sales from the yearly low seen in the first three months of 2025.  \"We have not seen any panic from customers or immediate reaction,\" President and CEO Jean-Marc Chery told analysts on Thursday.  But while STMicro is well equipped to face the potential tariffs, it is wary of their impact on global automotive production, he said.  \"It's urgent to wait and see, because adaptation of the supply chain or decision to modify or structurally change the supply chain is very heavy in terms of qualification, in terms of transfer of product, and so on,\" Chery added.  He also said that STMicro could benefit from the tariff spat between the U.S. and China, as peers caught in the fight could lose market share to them.  \"ST could be a new vendor solution, taking into account this tariff increase for American peers in China.\"  STMicro's U.S. peer Texas Instruments also forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, with hopes of cyclical recovery soothing tariff concerns for now.  Chipmakers exposed to the automotive and industrial markets, like STMicro, NXP and Siltronic, have faced a multi-year long slump in sales. That led STMicro's operating income to collapse 99.5% year-on-year in the first quarter.  It forecast revenue of $2.71 billion in the second quarter, 16.2% lower than last year but above analysts' expectations of $2.62 billion. The outlook does not factor in any impact from potential further changes to global trade policies.  \"We believe the auto/industrial chip sector is at the early stages of a cyclical recovery from a deep trough, with improvement into H2-25 and 2026 regardless of macro-uncertainties,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.  STMicro did not provide a full-year guidance, but Chery said he expected revenue to be lower than last year.  First-quarter revenue was $2.52 billion, in line with STMicro's own forecast and analysts' estimates.  (Reporting by Nathan Vifflin in Gdansk, editing by Milla Nissi)\u001b[00m\n",

            " Reuters STMicro forecasts better quarterly sales, says no tariff panic yet  FILE PHOTO: The logo of STMIcroelectronics is seen outside a company building in Montrouge · Reuters Nathan Vifflin Thu, April 24, 2025 at 7:16 AM GMT+2 2 min read  In This Article: STMPA.PA +1.09%  By Nathan Vifflin  (Reuters) -STMicroelectronics said U.S. tariffs had so far not changed its conversations with customers, after the chipmaker forecast rising second-quarter sales from the yearly low seen in the first three months of 2025.  \"We have not seen any panic from customers or immediate reaction,\" President and CEO Jean-Marc Chery told analysts on Thursday.  But while STMicro is well equipped to face the potential tariffs, it is wary of their impact on global automotive production, he said.  \"It's urgent to wait and see, because adaptation of the supply chain or decision to modify or structurally change the supply chain is very heavy in terms of qualification, in terms of transfer of product, and so on,\" Chery added.  He also said that STMicro could benefit from the tariff spat between the U.S. and China, as peers caught in the fight could lose market share to them.  \"ST could be a new vendor solution, taking into account this tariff increase for American peers in China.\"  STMicro's U.S. peer Texas Instruments also forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, with hopes of cyclical recovery soothing tariff concerns for now.  Chipmakers exposed to the automotive and industrial markets, like STMicro, NXP and Siltronic, have faced a multi-year long slump in sales. That led STMicro's operating income to collapse 99.5% year-on-year in the first quarter.  It forecast revenue of $2.71 billion in the second quarter, 16.2% lower than last year but above analysts' expectations of $2.62 billion. The outlook does not factor in any impact from potential further changes to global trade policies.  \"We believe the auto/industrial chip sector is at the early stages of a cyclical recovery from a deep trough, with improvement into H2-25 and 2026 regardless of macro-uncertainties,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.  STMicro did not provide a full-year guidance, but Chery said he expected revenue to be lower than last year.  First-quarter revenue was $2.52 billion, in line with STMicro's own forecast and analysts' estimates.  (Reporting by Nathan Vifflin in Gdansk, editing by Milla Nissi)\u001b[00m\n",
